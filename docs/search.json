    "text": "Overview\nThis workbook provides a practical, step-by-step guide for medical students, residents, and fellows embarking on a clinical research project.\nThe focus is specifically on clinical epidemiology and health services research, reflecting both my expertise and the suitability of these areas for clinician-researchers (discussed further in What Type of Project Should You Do?).\nWhile numerous excellent resources exist, this guide uniquely emphasizes:\nIdeally, this guide serves as a complement to active mentorship, where a dedicated mentor can address specific questions and contextual challenges. However, as detailed in What Kind of Mentor(s) Do You Need?, mentorship can vary significantly in quality and depth. Some mentors might lack content-specific expertise (methodologists are unfortunately rare and highly sought-after) or sufficient involvement, making self-directed resources particularly valuable for trainees eager to independently advance their research skills.",

    "text": "Clinical Epidemiology or Health Services research (broadly defined as observational research on patterns of disease, medical care, and outcomes). Generally advisable because projects can be sufficiently small, short-timelne (needed for fellows/residents), and clinically relevant… and thus can be more useful in terms of understanding the application of research to clinical care, even if you end up doing a non-research job. Thus, this is the primary focus of this module. However, it is not the only option to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther types of research you might consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey research - this is the most tractable flavor of ‘prospective’ research for a trainee, as the regulatory requirements and data-accrual rate is amenable to trainee timelines. Often times, this can involved mixed-methods (where quantification is paired with interviews to understand qualitatively what factors influence or lead to observed outcomes)\nMedical Education scholarship - undestandably, many trainees are interested in ways to improve the trainee experience. And there is lots of room for improvement. However, educational scholarship really needs rigorous assessment to generate generalizable knowledge. Thus, good educational research ends up overlapping substantially with the concepts discussed here.trainees who want to be medical educators should learn research skills because curricular evaluation is an increasingly important component of education (and still should be more important than it is)\nBasic science - I do not cover this much here because I’m not qualified to. My impression is that it’s harder to have a successful basic science project as a trainee, but some motivated folks do manage. If you’re basic science committed or curious, fellowship is the time to try. (nothing against basic science per-se.. some of this may pertain, but I have no first hand experience on how to do that well.\nSystematic Review and Meta-analysis - these are a suprisingly large amount of work, and require a team to complete. If pursuing, I would recommend to do as part of a structured experience (e.g. a course) or with a group who has experience with each of the roles (ie. a librarian, duplicate data assessors/extractors, etc.). The main risk of this sort of project is that it’s easy to get scooped, there are many groups competing to meta-analyze new data when it comes, and it’s hard to think of good research gaps that are answerable with available studies but haven’t been aswered (this is, at it’s core, the crux of doing a SRMA)\nOther reviews - ideally, if doing this you’d want to know you have a mentor with an “in” for getting it published - whether that’s an invitation or gravitas in the relevant field.\nSecondary (retrospective) analyses of existing data-sets (e.g. from prospective cohorts or previously completed trials)\nRandomized trials are the gold standard workhorse of medical evidence, but are generally not feasible for most trainees to substantively contribute to, owing to the time required, regulatory burden, and resources required.",

    "text": "1.3 What makes an interesting (good) research question?\nSay you’ve decided you’re going to do clinical research, and you’re going to work with a mentor to identify a suitable project that gets you excited and your mentor(s) can support.\nIt’s worth considering a few things before delving into an investigation on a particular sutdy question:\nFirst, you must have a way to get the needed data in order to answer the question. Collecting\nConsider your research edge: do you have access to data that know one else can get? if so, you can do research that no one else can.\nDo you have an idea that no-one else has had? (believe it or not, there is a large role for clearer thinking on topics.. so the fact that no-one has done it yet doesn’t necessarily mean that no one could do it)\nDo you have a new way of looking at the same data as others? e.g. either new methodologies or hypotheses that can be re-evaluated in light of subsequent evidence. Consider\n\n1.3.1 What type of Question?\nMost research is inferential: attempting to support inferences about causes and effects. Even most research that claims to be about associations is actually about cause and effect . In some ways this makes sense - we want to understand cause and effect so that we can intervene. However, when working with observational data (ie. not running an experiment - such as a trial), it’s very hard to meet all the assumptions required to identify a causal effect (see (sec?)-***)\nDescriptive epidemiology: [ ] find the paper\nHowever, an alternative objective is to just describe something, i.e. descriptive epidemiology. How often does something happen? What is the ultimate outcome for patients who face a particular situation? What is the base rate of occurence of a diagnosis? The assumptions required to support such a question are often much more believable than establishing cause and effect.\nA researcher will often face a dilemma - do we attempt to use the available data to support a potentially dubious argument about cause and effect? Or robustly describe something? As a matter of personal preference - it seems to me usually better to go with the descriptive (ie. more strongly supported) Question\n\n1.3.2 Exploratory vs Confirmatory Research\nYou can’t propose and confirm a theory based on the same data.\nOne way of framing this issue is categorizing research as either exploratory or confirmatory. In exploratory research, you can look through the data and see what relationships are there. You can look at as many potential relationships as you want and see which ones are interesting. However, when you find one - you have to keep in mind that you’ve had many opportunities to find a relationship, and thus metrics based on controllign the false positive rate (such as p-values) aren’t valid.\nIf, however, you already have a theory and you plan to test it in your data - this is confirmatory research. For reasons we’ll explain in the (intro_stat?) section, you should pre-specify your theory, analysis, and criteria for success before looking at the data. Pre-registration is the recommended way to commit to an analysis plan.\nThis is a high bar that most research doesn’t meet. That’s OK, but you just have to be transparent about it.\n[ ] Exploratory research: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2025.2486871\n\n1.3.3 ‘Bullshit science’\nThere is a lot of low quality medical science that gets done by trainees. By this, I mean research that cannot answer the question it seeks to investigate, either due to issues with study design, data, or analysis. This is not judgement on the trainees (I’ve been there), but a statement about the end-product - which either makes a compelling argument or it doesn’t.\nMethodologists have long recognized ([ ] Bland Altman) the reason for the excess of low-quality medical research: incentives. There’s much less reward for critiquing research than there is in doing it, and you’re not likely to make friends in close-knit research communities by poking wholes in your colleagues work. For trainees particularly, research is correctly perceived as the only way to have a compelling application to the best training programs (whether one ultimately wants to do research or not). This leads to a commodification of research, where the number of posters, presentations, and manuscripts are tallied in an application, rather than judged on whether there was a novel and rigorous contribution.\nThis is, of course, a waste. Trainees doing bullshit research to check boxes both dilutes scientific norms and we’d be better off if we decoupled research from applications. Thankfully, there’s plenty of real research that should be done. So, while it may take a bit more effort and activation, you can always decline to do bullshit research. If you ever think to yourself “I don’t really care what this research finds”, you should consider why you’re going through the process at all. Life is too short to waste your time doing bullshit science.",

    "text": "5.1 The Disjunctive Syllogism\nThe goal of this section is to build an intuition for what statistical tests accomplish, and what the assumptions are. (A plug for a book called Intuitive Biostatistics by Harvey Motulsky - it is excellent. Highly recommend.)\nBy the end of this page, you should have an intuitive sense of what a p-value is (and what it is not) and the role that it plays in the argument of a scientific report.\nTo forecast the punchline: We seek to make arguments that observed relationships are not explained by confounding, bias, or chance - and therefore must be causation. P-values summarize how surprising it would be to see the observed data, assuming there is nothing going on and the assumptions of the test hold.\nWe’ll start out abstract, and become more concrete.\nThe root of the problem is that we don’t directly observe cause and effect. Instead, we must make an argument for it.\nThe structure of the usual scientific argument mirrors Sherlock Holmes quote:\nThis “argument-by-excluding-alternatives” is termed the disjunctive syllogism. NOTE: this isn’t the only possible argument - for example, likelihoodism (and by extension, Bayesianism), makes the argument that when comparing a hypothesis to the alternative hypotheses the data would be much less likely. etc.\nIn the language of epidemiology, we’re interested in the relationship between an “exposure” (meant broadly - could refer to a treatment, an occupational exposure, a characteristics, etc.) and an “outcome” (also meant broadly, could be the occurence of an event, a side effect, a health state, etc.).\nIf an exposure and an outcome are associated, there are 4 possible explanations:\nThus, the way we’ll seek evidence for causation is indirect. First, we’ll show there is an association. Then, we’ll make arguments against the possibility of confounding, bias, and chance explaining the association. If the reader accepts there’s an association but that reasons 1-3 are not plausible explanations, they’re left accepting causation as an explanation.",

    "text": "5.3 How to formulate your scientific question as a statistically testable hypothesis?\nWithout a doubt, the most common error trainees make when formulating their scientific hypothesis as a (statistically-)testable hypothesis is not realizing that you must define a null hypothesis where there is no effect, then find evidence against it - so-called Null Hypotheses Significance Testing. It goes something like this:\n\nScientifically, I suspect that high PaCO2 levels indicate a patient is at higher risk of 30-day readmission\nThe null hypothesis is that PaCO2 levels are not associated with risk of 30-day readmission\nI then evaluate the numbers of readmissions across the range of PaCO2 levels and ask the question: is there a substantial enough excess in readmissions among patients with higher PaCO2 levels that it’s unlikely to be explainable just by random variation?\nif it’s more suspicious than getting heads 4.32 times in a row, we say that chance alone can’t explain it.\n\n(Note, I’ll need to make separate arguments that confounders or biased assessment of either PaCO2 or readmission could explain it, if I want to make a convincing argument is the PaCO2 per se - for more on that, Chapter 6)\n\n5.3.1 Severity:\nA last topic that I’ve included here - but would often usually be introduced later… but I think warrants early exposure - is statistical severity. If we zoom out - we see that we’re generating exclusionary evidence against “null” hypothesis - but we’re not necessarily summarizing the strength of evidence in favor of a hypothesis.\nHow should we summarize how much evidence for a hypothesis? The idea is that we have evidence in favor of a theory in proportion to the strength of challenges it has survived. For example, if theres a theory that makes a prediction that would be extremely unlikely to occur unless the theory is true -e.g. einstein predicting the gravity-induced curvature of light - but then the evidence does NOT disprove it… that’s pretty strong evidence - because that test was severe.\nSimilarly, if you prespecify an analysis - stick to the statistical analysis plan, and find an effect - that’s a much stronger challenge than if you have a lot of ways to slice the data or analyze the effect. Prespecification is more severe.\nApplied to your design - you want to balance power (see Chapter 4) and severity. ***",

    "text": "Must you learn to do your own stats?\nStrictly speaking, no. Not every successful clinician-researcher masters statistics or study design. Research increasingly involves collaborative teams, where methodologists and/or statisticians can handle technical details. In fact, some advocate for involving a statistician in every research project, a model that is more feasible in well-resourced settings.\nHowever, relying exclusively on others for statistical expertise has important drawbacks:\n\nSpeed: Conducting at least basic analyses yourself substantially accelerates research.\nEffectiveness: Understanding key statistical concepts enables more productive interactions with the rest of the research team, as you’re more likely to understand key issues and understand the proposed solutions.\nIndependence: Dependence on external expertise restricts the range of research questions you can feasibly explore.\nEducational Value: A stated reason (see note) that many training programs retain research requirements is that familiarity with study design and statistics directly enhances clinical practice by improving your interpretation of research literature. Outsourcing related tasks will not help you critically evaluate evidence or apply findings effectively to patient care.\n\nNote: There are less complimentary reasons that explain why such requirements actually persist.\nFor these reasons and others, I strongly recommend acquiring statistical and study design skills, even though it’s not strictly required in all cases. I still recommend it even if you have access to statisticians and methodologists because it will help you interact with them, and it’ll help you appraise the research.",

    "text": "1.2 What Kind of Mentor(s) Do You Need?\nThe perfect mentor doesn’t exist, and even good mentors are challenging to identify.\nThe concept of “mentoring up” has a lot of value. Essentially, the idea is to be thoughtful about what you want from a mentor, and being proactive about facilitating that.\nI think there is a spectrum from “entirely under your mentors wing” (your mentor has a project in mind and you do it) to “free-range mentorship” (you have an idea, but enroll a mentors help). In the case where there is an available mentor that is working on something that is working on exactly what you’re interested in, there’s no trade-off. The classic arrangement is entirely under your mentors wing - and this has the highest chance of getting a worthwhile result for the least amount of trouble/work.\nHowever, trainee-driven research has it’s benefits and can work [ ]EBTapper Paper. First, the rate-limiting resource is enthusiasm, so choosing an idea you’re excited about (ie. addressing a gap you feel passionate about) may ultimately be a good strategy. Furthermore, the process of identifying a gap, and finding a feasible way to address that gap really is the most interesting bit of research - so it’s a shame to cede that roll to the mentor. There’s something fulfilling about seeing an idea through from start to finish. If you do opt for a proposal that is more free-range, ensure your mentor is still going to be adequately supportive and can help to get the resources you may need.\nConversely, you should know that a trainee-initiated research project is going to be riskier and more work, so make the choice informed by how motivated you are to drive your research forward. I’d advice you to not go all the way in either direction.\nFood for thought - but consider taking a bit more autonomy in project creation than mentors might suggest.\nGreat summarization of early career approach: https://www.aasurg.org/blog/moving-forward-going-faster-scaling-impact-strategies-to-develop-early-career-surgeon-scientists/\nFigure idea: How do you find a good study question?

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1.1 Exposures\nThe ‘cause’ that we investigate is generally termed the exposure. This could represent a specific exposure (in the common language sense), like air pollution. But it is also used to refer to treatment group assignment of 0 or 1 in a trial, or things that aren’t modified per se, like race/ethnicity, if we’re interested on the influence of that variable on our outcome of interest.\n\n4.1.2 Outcome\nThe thing you’re interesting in measuring is referred to as the outcome. Choosing an outcome is not as simple as it would seem. Consider a trial of a medication for ARDS.\nA common argument is made for using “hard outcomes”, like whether a patient died or not 90-days after they were enrolled in the trial. A benefit to this type of outcome is that when an effect is found, there’s little doubt as to whether it’s important or how to quantify the magnitude. We can then choose one of a handful of measure to summarize the effect: a risk ratio (risk of death among exposed over risk of death among non-exposed), the risk difference (risk of death among exposed - risk of death in the unexposed), or the odds ratio ( [exposed alive / exposed dead] / [nonexposed alive / non-exposed dead] Odds ratio : https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/test.12391 ).\nHowever, the downside is that the outcome doesn’t contain much information, so a binary outcome is not very efficient. All we get is whether a patient died or not at 90-days. For the exposure to be shown to have an effect, there must be enough patients where they would have died if they hadn’t received the treatment, but would survive with it. For everyone else (they were destined to live or destined to die regardless of the exposure), we don’t learn anything. Consequently, it takes a lot of patients in the trial to convincingly separate signal from noise.\nA variety of more informative end-point could be used: - you could define an ordinal outcome like: alive and independent at 90-days, alive but discharged to facility, alive but still in acute care, or dead - which increases the power as you now can learn something from patients who would potentially switch categories. Sometimes this effect is quantified using a win ratio or a proportional odds ratio - you could look at time to death, knowing that death won’t be observed in many patients (called right censoring). This means that you’d capture even the patients where the treatment kept them alive for longer, but not enough for their to be a counterfactual difference at 90-days (which generally increases the power, but might not mirror what we care about so much). This is a more efficient option when more people have the outcome. - you could model the duration of respiratory support on each day in the following period, such as using a longitudinal ordinal model. That way, you have many opportunities to learn whether the exposure is having an effect (each day, it can be influencing the amount of ventilator support). However, the outcome of the analysis may be harder to quantify and also may be less patient centered.\nEndpoint considerations: https://hbiostat.org/endpoint/\n\n4.1.3 Considerations in choosing an outcome\n‘Signal to noise’: [ ] maybe move this to the study design one? I think so - cover power at the same time.\nif the alternative hypothesis is that the coin is subtly imbalanced, it’ll be a much harder to detect signal. This is the logic of power analysis - if you’re looking for a subtle signal (e.g. small difference, noisy data, rare events), you’ll need a bigger study.\nHowever, there is no free lunch: a statistical tests makes assumptions about the data, and if those assumptions hold in reality, then the implications from the analysis follow.\nExample interpretation:\nIf the p-value from a Chi2 test is P=0.03 - we say it’s as unlikely this would occur from just chance as it would be to flip a fair coin heads 5 times in a row.\nIF observations are independent; both variables are categorical; there are enough observations of each, then it is unlikely chance alone explains the difference. \n[ ] cover signal to noise ratio: history? https://www.sensible-med.com/p/doing-statistics-can-be-difficult\nWhat’s power got to do with it?\nEverything is underpowered ***\nPower - https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/test.12403?campaign=wolearlyview",

    "text": "5.2 What’s a P-value good for?\nTo provide evidence for cause and effect, we need compelling arguments against confounding, bias, and chance. Arguments against confounding are best done by by study design (e.g. randomization) but can be addressed using statistical methods (see Chapter 6). Bias is best addressed by careful choice of instruments/assessments, but can also be supported by elements of study design (e.g. blinding).\nWhether or not chance is a plausible explanation or not is where P-values come in. Repeated for emphasis: P-values ONLY address the plausibilit of chance explaining an apparent association. Having a low p-value tells you nothing about whether confounding or bias could explain an association - you need other arguments for that.\n\n5.2.1 Intuitively, what is a p-value?\nIf there was no association, how surprising would it be to see the observed data?\n\nif there is a large p-value, it would not be very surprising to see the observed data by just the play of chance.\nif the p-value is small, then it would be quite surprising to see the observed data if there’s really nothing going on.\n\nNote: the P-value is not comparing one hypothesis to another (ie. an alternative hypothesis). Nor is it saying how likely it would be to find an effect if there is something going on - it’s just saying: “if there’s actually nothing going on here (ie. no causal effect, no confounding, no bias), how unlikely would this finding be?\nThis is a conditional probability: “IF nothing is going on” (or, assume nothing is going on), then, how unlikely would this be. The notation is P ( observed_data | nothing going on).\nBox: note that p-values are NOT a measure of how strong evidence is. A finding with p-value 0.03 isn’t necessarily less robust even than p-value 0.001 - even if there is no bias or confounding. Consider, a huge study can have a very small p-value (unlikely chance.. but could be a small amount of bias, confounding, or a trivial effect), or a smaller study could have a larger p-value. This is termed “Lindley’s Paradox”\n\n5.2.2 How surprising is too surprising?\nArguing by coincidence begs the question: how surprising does something have to be before you say “there must be something going on here!”.\nLuckily, you can convert P-values to coin flips to get an intuitive sense (look inside the box for the actual conversion, but feel free to skip of logarithms make you queasy).  \nBox: “Shannon Transform: S-value”\nIn a world where the null value is true (ie. either heads or tails is equally likely to occur; but it’s going to be one of those two), you can characterize how suprising it would be to see a particular sequence. this is calculated by S-value = -log_2_ P-value.\nHere’s the setup… say I start flipping a coin, how many consecutive “Heads” need to occur before you’ll suspect it’s not a fair coin? \n\n\nSequence\nFlips (S-Value)\nP-value\n\n\nHH\n2 flips\n0.25\n\n\nHHH\n3 flips\n0.125\n\n\nHHHH\n4 flips\n0.0625\n\n\n\n4.32 flips\n0.05\n\n\nHHHHH\n5 flips\n0.03125\n\n\nMore at: https://stat.lesslikely.com/s-values/\nIMPORTANT POINT: the p-value is NOT the probability that the coin is biased. It is the probability of seeing that result (or more extreme) ASSUMING the coin is biased. \nSo, to answer the question from the lede… the specific answer to “How surprising is too surprising for chance to be a compelling explanation? Since we, as a community, have agreed that P = 0.05 is the threshold… a bit more surprising than 4 consecutive heads with a fair coin is too suspicious.\nBox: Multiplicity understanding multiplicity: If we all flipped a coin 5 times, what is the chance that one of us would get 5 heads in a row? \n\nIf 10 people = (1-0.03125)^10 = 0.727.  23.3% of at least 1 HHHHH -&gt; we’re back to weak evidence of a real effect. \nThis is obviously true when multiple tests are reported, but less obviously also true if you try several analyses and choose the “best one” after seeing the result. Hence, prespecification.\n\nBox: What, then, do confidence intervals mean?\nNote - it’s NOT that there’s a 95% chance that the true value is within this range. It’s if you execute this method 100 times, you’d the value to be outside the range 5% of the time. [ ].gif\nHow do you choose the right test?\nWe have to go one step further to understand where the P-value comes from because of one sneaky clause that I snuck into the definition of the p-value. Quote: “P-values summarize how surprising it would be to see the observed data, assuming there is nothing going on and the assumptions of the test hold.”\nLike regression models (covered soon Chapter 6), there are many statistical tests, each of which requires assumptions to be made. The main characteristics of the data that allow one to choose an appropriate tests are how many groups, the size of the groups, the type of variable, and whether measurements are independent of each other (ie. knowing one observation tells you nothing about another) or correlated (e.g. observation from the same patient at two different times)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of measurement of outcome variable\nTwo Independent Groups\nThree or more Independent Groups\nTwo Correlated* Samples\nThree or more Correlated* Samples\n\n\n\nDichotomous\n(e.g. yes/no)\n\n\nchi-square or Fisher’s exact test\n\nchi-square or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test\nMcNemar test\nCochran Q test\n\n\n\nUnordered Categorical\n(e.g. red/blue/grey)\n\n\nchi-square or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test\n\nchi-square or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test\nStuart-Maxwell test\nMultiplicity adjusted Stuart-Maxwell tests#\n\n\n\n\nOrdered categorical\n(e.g. bad, neutral, good)\n\nWilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test\n\nOld School***: Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nNew School***: multiplicity adjusted WMW test\n\nWilcoxon sign rank test\n\nOld School# Friedman two-way ANOVA by ranks\nNew School# Mulitiplicity adjusted Wilcoxon sign rank tests\n\n\n\n\nContinuous\n(e.g. BMI)\n\nindependent groups t-test\n\nOld school***: oneway ANOVA\nNew school***: multiplicity adjusted independent groups t tests\n\npaired t-test\nmixed effects linear regression\n\n\n\nTime to event\n(e.g. survival)\n\nlog-rank test\nMultiplicity adjusted log-rank test\nShared-frailty Cox regression\nShared-frailty Cox regression\n\n\n\nFrom: From: Stoddard GJ.

It’s helpful for our purposes because it can define the different ways that three variables may interrelate.\n\n6.1.1.1 Confounder (C)\nAs mentioned earlier, a confounder is something that influences both the likelihood of exposure and the likelihood of the outcome via other mechanisms than through the exposure.\nFor example, consider the risk of death in patients with elevated PaCO2 levels. Say that older patients are more likely to get hypercapnia. In an unadjusted analysis, PaCO2 levels might be associated with death because age is associated with likelihood of hypercapnia, and likelihood of death via a variety of mechanisms. In this case, what we’d really like to do is evaluate whether PaCO2 levels remain associated with the risk of death after controlling for age (a confounder).\n[ ] DAG.\n\n6.1.1.2 Mediator (M)\nAnother way\n(cover this here? or elsewhere)\n\n6.1.1.3 Effect Modifier\nEffect modifiers (and the related concept of interactions) refer to situations where a third variable influences the effect of the exposure on the outcome. As a hypothetical example, a bacterial pathogen is presumably an effect modifier for response to antibiotics on community acquired pneumonia: if bacterial CAP, antibiotics help, and if viral it probably doesn’t.\nThis might seem like a very distinct concept from mediators and confounders - and it is. But the reason I bring it up here is that it’ll appear similar in regression analyses if not specified.",

However, observational research must make arguments (based on assumptions) and they must be explicit. Randomization addresses point 2 (essentially, converts it to point 1, in that only chance confounding can occur)\nFor non-randomized data, you must make an argument against point 2. This is the most common use of regression. \n[the methods section of your paper is the argument against point 3; pull in RECORD/STROBE recs]\nThere are at least 3 uses of regression models: \n\nInferential Statistics: Hypothesis testing with confounding control\nDescriptive Statistics: Summarize the strength of association\nPrediction of an outcome (e.g. statistical machine learning)\n\nRegression comes with additional assumptions: \n\nIndependent observations (special “mixed models” can relax this)\nThe form of the output variable is correct* \nThe form of the predictor variables are correct\nThe relationship between the predictors are properly specified.**\nAdditional constraints (e.g. constant variance)\n\nThus the logic is: if the assumptions of the models hold in reality, then the described relationships are valid\n\nNo model is perfect, but some models are useful\n\n\nMorris moment(TM)\n\nOutput variable (aka the dependent variable, predicted variable) form determines the type of regression : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of measurement of outcome variable\nTwo Independent Groups without Confounding Adjustment\nTwo Independent Groups without Confounding Adjustment\n\n\nDichotomous\nChi2 Test\nlogistic regression\n\n\nUnordered categorical\nChi2 Test\nmultinomial logistic regression\n\n\nOrdered categorical\nWilcoxon-Mann-Whitney\nordinal logistic regression\n\n\nContinuous (normally distributed)\nT-test\nlinear regression\n\n\nCensored: time to event\nLog-rank test\nCox regression\n\n\n\nFrom: From: Stoddard GJ. Biostatistics and Epidemiology Using Stata: A Course Manual. Salt Lake City, UT: University of Utah School of Medicine.\nInterpretation:\nRegression coefficient = What change in the outcome do you expected if you change the predictor by 1 unit, holding all other variables constant\n\nFor linear regression: additive change in outcome\nFor logistic regression: multiplicative change in odds of the outcome\nFor Cox regression: multiplicative change in the hazard of the outcome. \n\nExample:\nConsider, if we want to test whether ‘splenectomy’ and ‘got_cteph?’ are associated, we could use a chi2 test:\n\n#chi2_test_result &lt;- chisq.test(darren_data_sheet$splenectomy, darren_data_sheet$`got_cteph?`)\n#print(chi2_test_result)\n\nAlternatively you could specify a logistic regression\n(“GLM” standards for ‘general linear model’. Logistic regression is a type of glm where the family is binomial)\n\n#logistic_model &lt;- glm(`got_cteph?` ~ splenectomy, data = darren_data_sheet, family = binomial())\n\n# Output the summary of the model to see coefficients and statistics\n#summary(logistic_model)\n\n\n\nCausal relationship of Splenectomy and CTEPH\n\n(https://www.dagitty.net/dags.html Daggity is a tool to specify such diagrams)\n\n#logistic_model_updated &lt;- glm(`got_cteph?` ~ splenectomy + prox_v_dist, data = darren_data_sheet, family = binomial())\n#summary(logistic_model_updated)\n\n\n\nCausal diagram of Splenectomy, Prox_v_dist, and CTEPH\n\nConsider: do you want the adjusted or the unadjusted estimate? \nHint: it depends….\nDistributions:\n\nRegressions -\n[ ] create the linear regression interpretation and example.\nlogic of different choices… ie. “under the following assumptions this is the estimate” - thus, if you make different assumptions, you make a different answers. Therefore, knowing the assumptinos are very important for knowing whether the result is believable.\nModels - you choose a way to distill the relationships that are contingent on certain assumptions - and if those assumptions hold, your conclusions follow.\nDAGs What does it mean to control? https://idlhy0218.github.io/page%20building/blog.html#control\nConceptually - you are modeling something… all models are wrong, some models are useful.
