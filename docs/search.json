    "text": "Overview\nThis workbook is intended to function as a guide to get students, residents, or fellows started on the right foot on a research project.\nThere are many guides and publications covering this topic. The reason I made yet another is to better target the unique constraints and backgrounds of clinical trainees, and also to cover content relevant to my field - Internal Medicine (specifically, Pulmonary and Critical Care)\nThis guide is intended to act as a supplement to an involved mentor, who can answer context-specific questions and clarify things in a more interactive way. However, as discussed more in mentors - there are a spectrum of arrangements that work, and self-directed researchers may find more use for materials like this.\n[ ] Reframe this as a guide for trainees (whether working with me or whoever you’re working with)\nAlso - the nerds have a concept called ‘Tacit Knowledge’ that I think is extremely useful: how do people who actually do this well operate?\nSee ?sec-instructions for more details on … etc",

Conversely, your mentor can come up with an idea that serves their interests/purposes. Occasionally, those two will align perfectly - in which case go. But, if there’s not - you need to do a bit of a trade-off, informed by how motivated you are to drive your research forward.
