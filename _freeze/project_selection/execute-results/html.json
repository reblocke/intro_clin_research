This is covered at the end.\n\n- If you’re basic science committed or curious, fellowship is the time to try. (nothing against basic science per-se.. some of this may pertain, but I have no first hand experience on how to do that well. I will discuss medical decision-making and education at the end)\n\n## What makes an interesting (good) research question? {#sec-question}\n\nHow do you find a good study question? (unique dataset? unique analysis? - why hasn’t it been done before?)\n- there is always a balance between what you find interesting, what potential mentors are working on, and what will be feasible in a fellow timeline.   [ ] venn diagram. \n\nWhat’s the roll of your mentor? on the spectrum from easy to hard ( but also fulfilling vs not) - here’s the trade-off: follow what’s interesting to you, but if you completely do that, you’ll be out on your own and it’ll be a lot of work. Conversely, your mentor can come up with an idea that serves their interests/purposes. Occasionally, those two will align perfectly - in which case go. But, if there’s not - you need to do a bit of a trade-off, informed by how motivated you are to drive your research forward. I’d advice you to not go all the way in either direction. \n\n\n\nGreat summarization of early career approach: https://www.aasurg.org/blog/moving-forward-going-faster-scaling-impact-strategies-to-develop-early-career-surgeon-scientists/ \n\n\n### Types of Observational Questions\n\nExploratory research - gets a bad rap. \n\nDescriptive Epidemiology: there's a good case that just describing something can be extremely useful. Base rates in clinical reasoning, natural history, etc.\n\nInferential epidemiology (ie, making )\n-- risk factors is Cavier a risk factor for being rich paper? (actually, maybe this is better to talk about in regression settings)\n\nExploratory research: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2025.2486871\n\nDescriptive epidemiology: [ ] find the paper \n\n\nDescriptive vs inferential statistics. \n\nRisk factors - \n\n### A note on rigor and 'bullshit science'\n\n[ ] Bland Altman\nA note on rigor: It’s almost cliche’ at this point: we have too much research for all of the wrong reasons. You don’t want to churn out more bullshit that no one cares about. Yet, most medical trainees need some sort of project to progress in their career. A few know they want to do research. And even more are somewhere on the fence - where doing really good research might be appealing, but htey may get stuck doing bullshit if they’re not careful. \n\n\n\nThe `project` key defines the inputs and outputs for the book.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Do we need less research?\n\nYes, and research done for the right reasons -  or so they say.  \n\n:::\n\n\nBelow here is just the leftover from the initial document. \n\nThe `output-dir` key defines the directory where the rendered web files will be saved. This is set to `docs` in order to be compatible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but you can change this if you are working with a different repository that expects the web files to be in a different directory.\n\nThe `resources` key specifies a directory that is copied verbatim to the output directory. This is where you should put, for example, data files that you want to make accessible online (sometimes they don't automatically copy over when linked).\n\n#### Book Options\n\nThe `book` key defines options that affect the look and function of the book ([quarto reference](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html#section)).\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## book key\n\n``` yaml\nbook:\n  title: Book\n  subtitle: ~\n  author: ~\n  doi: ~\n  license: CC-BY 4.0\n  description: ~\n  cover-image: images/logos/logo.png\n  image: images/logos/logo.png\n  favicon: images/logos/logo.png\n  cookie-consent: false\n  google-analytics: ~\n  page-navigation: true\n  search: true\n  # comments:\n  #   hypothesis:\n  #     theme: clean\n  #     openSidebar: false\n  downloads: ~\n  sharing: ~\n  sidebar:\n    title: ~\n    logo: ~\n    search: true\n    contents: ~\n    style: floating\n    background: ~\n    foreground: ~\n    border: true\n    alignment: left\n    collapse-level: 3\n    pinned: true\n    header: \"\"\n    footer: \"\"\n  margin-header: ~\n  page-footer:\n    left: ~\n    right: ~\n  chapters:\n  - index.qmd\n  - instructions.qmd\n  appendices:\n  - references.qmd\n```\n:::\n\n#### html Options\n\nThe `format` key defines options for specific formats, such as html or pdf.
