The reason I made yet another is to better target the unique constraints and backgrounds of clinical trainees, and also to cover content relevant to my field - Internal Medicine (specifically, Pulmonary and Critical Care)\n\nThis guide is intended to act as a supplement to an involved mentor, who can answer context-specific questions and clarify things in a more interactive way. However, as discussed more in mentors - there are a spectrum of arrangements that work, and self-directed researchers may find more use for materials like this. \n\n[ ] Reframe this as a guide for trainees (whether working with me or whoever youâ€™re working with)\n\nAlso - the nerds have a concept called 'Tacit Knowledge' that I think is extremely useful: how do people who actually do this well operate? \n\n\n## Learning Objectives:\n\n1.  Set Up Statistical Software\n2.  Share \"tacit knowledge\" (how it's actually done) of how to choose a statistical analyses and perform it.\n3.  Understanding the structure of frequentist statistical tests\n4.  Understand the logic of regression models\n\n**Bad news**: you'll need to learn how to do statistical analyses:\n\n-   realistically, you'll probably have to do your own stats somewhat\n-   if you join a project that has a statistican (or get CTSI assistance), you'll still need to be able to specify, critique, and interpret the analyses. It will help substantially to have (at least) basic working knowledge.\n\n\nSee @sec-instructions for more details on ...  etc\n\n\n## About {.unnumbered}\n\nI am an Assistant Professor of Research in the Department of Critical Care at Intermountain Medical Center. I am core faculty in the University of Utah Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellowship Program and Internal Medicine Residency. Academically, I focus on hypercapnic respiratory failure epidemiology, clinical reasoning, and research informatics.
