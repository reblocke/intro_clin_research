Highly recommend.\n\n\\[ \\] cover signal to noise ratio: history? https://www.sensible-med.com/p/doing-statistics-can-be-difficult\n\n## Objective 3: the Logic of Frequentist Inferential Statistics\n\nHume: we cannot directly observe causation \n\n![](images/clipboard-1623586370.png)\n\n![David Hume: causation is never directly observed](images/Allan_Ramsay_-_David_Hume,_1711_-_1776._Historian_and_philosopher_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg){fig-alt=\"David Hume\" width=\"400\"}\n\nIf there is an association between an 'exposure' and an 'outcome', there are 4 possible explanations\n\n1.  Chance\n2.  Confounding (some other factor influences the exposure and the outcome)\n3.  Bias\n4.  Or, causation (meaning, a real effect)\n\n**Disjunctive syllogism**:\n\n> When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. \n\n\\- Sherlock Holmes\n\n\\*note: Bayesian analysis follows a different logic. \n\n**P-values ONLY address possibility 1:** how likely is it that chance alone could explain the observed result If the two variables were not correlated, what the likeliihood that you'd see as extreme results or more - just as a result of chance? \n\nConsider: if I start flipping a coin, how many consecutives \"Heads\" need to occur before you'll suspect it's not a fair coin? \n\n|              |            |             |\n|--------------|------------|-------------|\n| **Sequence** | **Flips**  | **P-value** |\n| HH           | 2 flips    | 0.25        |\n| HHH          | 3 flips    | 0.125       |\n| HHHH         | 4 flips    | 0.0625      |\n|              | 4.32 flips | 0.05        |\n| HHHHH        | 5 flips    | 0.03125     |\n\nMore at: <https://stat.lesslikely.com/s-values/>\n\n**IMPORTANT POINT:** the p-value is [NOT]{.underline} the probability that the coin is biased. It is the probability of seeing that result (or more extreme) [ASSUMING]{.underline} the coin is biased. \n\nSidebar: understanding multiplicity: If we all flipped a coin 5 times, what is the chance that one of us would get 5 heads in a row? \n\n-   If 10 people = (1-0.03125)\\^10 = 0.727.  23.3% of at least 1 HHHHH -\\> we're back to weak evidence of a real effect. \n-   This is obviously true when multiple tests are reported, but less obviously also true if you try several analyses and choose the \"best one\" after seeing the result. Hence, prespecification.\n\n**'Signal to noise'**: if the alternative hypothesis is that the coin is subtly imbalanced, it'll be a much harder to detect signal. This is the logic of power analysis - if you're looking for a subtle signal (e.g. small difference, noisy data, rare events), you'll need a bigger study.\n\nHowever, there is **no free lunch:** a statistical tests makes assumptions about the data, and if those assumptions hold in reality, then the implications from the analysis follow.\n\nExample interpretation:\n\nIf the p-value from a Chi2 test is P=0.03 - we say it's as unlikely this would occur from just chance as it would be to flip a fair coin heads 5 times in a row.\n\nIF observations are independent; both variables are categorical; there are enough observations of each, then it is unlikely chance alone explains the difference. \n\nUsing the usual significance threshold (alpha), IF the assumptions hold, we conclude it is unlikely chance alone caused the finding (though it could have been confounding, bias, or a real effect).\n\n**How do you choose the right test?**\n\nWhat type of variables? How many groups? Are the samples correlated (e.g. observation from the same patient at two different times)?\n\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Level of measurement of outcome variable** | **Two Independent Groups**                   | **Three or more Independent Groups**                                 | **Two Correlated\\* Samples**  | **Three or more Correlated\\* Samples**                           |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Dichotomous                                  | **chi-square** or Fisher's exact test        | **chi-square** or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test                         | McNemar test                  | Cochran Q test                                                   |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Unordered Categorical                        | **chi-square** or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test | **chi-square** or Fisher-Freeman-Halton test                         | Stuart-Maxwell test           | Multiplicity adjusted Stuart-Maxwell tests^*\\#*^                 |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Ordered categorical                          | **Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test**         | *Old School\\*\\*\\*:* Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA)      | Wilcoxon sign rank test       | *Old School^\\#^* Friedman two-way ANOVA by ranks                 |\n|                                              |                                              |                                                                      |                               |                                                                  |\n|                                              |                                              | *New School\\*\\*\\*:* multiplicity adjusted WMW test                   |                               | *New School^\\#^* Mulitiplicity adjusted Wilcoxon sign rank tests |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Continuous                                   | **independent groups t-test**                | *Old school\\*\\*\\*:* oneway ANOVA                                     | **paired t-test**             | mixed effects linear regression                                  |\n|                                              |                                              |                                                                      |                               |                                                                  |\n|                                              |                                              | *New school\\*\\*\\*:* multiplicity adjusted independent groups t tests |                               |                                                                  |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Censored: time to event                      | **log-rank test**                            | Multiplicity adjusted log-rank test                                  | Shared-frailty Cox regression | Shared-frailty Cox regression                                    |\n+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nFrom: From: Stoddard GJ.
