Punch intro sentences to paragraphs, end paragraphs that collect the important points then transition to the next. One idea per paragraph.\n\nEditing: \n\nWriting <https://twitter.com/samirshahmd/status/1526917833912946693?s=21&t=_0rCq0fFXkdkj1-069zuNw>\n\nElements of academic style <https://twitter.com/juliencayla/status/1574628448680566784?s=12&t=eyTORVO29cWHwMChGFjQeQ> \n\n Academic Writing guides in the Academic Writing folder.\n\nGood writing habits – a little bit every day vs blocking off days at a time. Try to overcome inertia. \n\n--writing routines can also help initiate the writing process. Same chair and desk, and coffee. Set mini deadlines. \nGetting it down below the word limit: <https://twitter.com/scientistswrite/status/1636757776633307137?s=20> \n\nWriting Style: \n\nSentence structure / writing mechanics: \n\n-try to keep subjects and verbs together in sentences.\n\n-every unit of discourse should serve a function or make a single point\n\n-the end of a sentence is the ‘stress position’. The information presented at the end will have more impact.\n\n-the beginning of a sentence is the ‘topic position’ - structure sentences to match what you want them to be about: consider: pollen is dispersed by bees vs bees disperse pollen.  Topic position = what the sentence is about\n\n-linkage (forward and back) - when new information is introduced, it is better in the stress position; old information that is backward linking is better in the topic position.\n\n-linkage between sentences is what forms the basis for the logical argument - if you can follow from link to link from the start to conclusion, the argument is made. Gaps often occur when specialized knowledge leads an author to ‘assume’ the reader will know\n\n-   Make the action of a sentence articulated by the verb.\n\nAlways remove “fundamentally”, “certainly”, “basically”, “briefly”, “very” - and similar words which can be removed without changing the meaning at all. \n\nWriting a first draft: <https://tapper.substack.com/p/paper-writing-secrets?utm_campaign=post> \n\nSome advocate for Figures/legends -\\> methods -\\> results -\\> discussion -\\> introduction -\\> abstract/title\n\nBMC how to write… series (esp discussion. <https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0490-1>)\n\nWorkflow....\n\nFirst - agree on roles and authorship order -\n\nAuthorship order, corresponding author matters - <https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2004/01000/interpreting_authorship_order_and_corresponding.22.aspx> \n\nSecond - IRB authorization -\nFor IRB: \n\nIf you need PHI, get IRB and justify the need. Must minimize risk to patients (securely receive, store, and analyze - computing infrastructure)\n\n![](images/clipboard-1736681210.png)\n\n## Key Figures\n\nStart by making your key figures.\n\nVisualization vocabulary <https://www.ft.com/content/c7bb24c9-964d-479f-ba24-03a2b2df6e85>\n\nBetter diagrams advice: “<https://vexlio.com/blog/five-simple-things-that-will-immediately-improve-your-diagrams/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email”> - Fill shapes with 2–3 neutral-grey fills and remove outlines; assign darker greys to higher-priority elements; ensure text-to-background contrast ≥ 4.5 : 1.\\\n- Limit the palette to at most 2 accent colors in addition to greys; use color only for semantic categories or highlighting, never both.\\\n- Insert ample whitespace: group elements by proximity rather than bounding boxes, leave small gaps at connector endpoints, and offset labels/titles from their subjects.\\\n- Standardize shape, gap, and text sizes to a small fixed set and repeat consistently across the diagram.\\\n- Label every arrow or connector unless its meaning is unmistakable from context.\\\n- Increase all text sizes by roughly 20 percent beyond initial choice.\n\nOverall figure checklist <https://x.com/scientistswrite/status/1698718678722728212?s=46&t=5eJ6uoTQrbbYTlHIOnRYRg>\n\nbetter options than bar charts (such as dot plot) for continuous data. <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901488/> <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31657957/> \n\nRules for figures: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/graphics/\n\n1.  Use vector graphics such as eps or pdf. These scale properly and do not look fuzzy when enlarged. Do not use jpeg, bmp or png files as these will look fuzzy when enlarged, or if saved at very high resolutions will be enormous files. Jpegs in particular are designed for photographs not statistical graphics.\n\n2.  Use readable fonts. For graphics I prefer sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica or Arial. Make sure the font size is readable after the figure is scaled to whatever size it will be printed.\n\n3.  Avoid cluttered legends. Where possible, add labels directly to the elements of the plot rather than use a legend at all. If this won’t work, then keep the legend from obscuring the plotted data, and make it small and neat.\n\n4.  If you must use a legend, move it inside the plot, in a blank area.\n\n5.  No dark shaded backgrounds. Excel always adds a nasty dark gray background by default, and I’m always asking authors to remove it. Graphics print much better with a white background. The ggplot for R also uses a gray background (although it is lighter than the Excel default). I don’t mind the ggplot version so much as it is used effectively with white grid lines. Nevertheless, even the light gray background doesn’t lend itself to printing/photocopying. White is better.\n\n6.  Avoid dark, dominating grid lines (such as those produced in Excel by default). Grid lines can be useful, but they should be in the background (light gray on white or white on light gray).\n\n7.  Keep the axis limits sensible. You don’t have to include a zero (even if Excel wants you to). The defaults in R work well. The basic idea is to avoid lots of white space around the plotted data. \n\n8.  Make sure the axes are scaled properly. Another Excel problem is that the horizontal axis is sometimes treated categorically instead of numerically. If you are plotting a continuous numerical variable, then the horizontal axis should be properly scaled for the numerical variable. \n\n9.  Do not forget to specify units. \n\n10. Tick intervals should be at nice round numbers.\n\n11. Axes should be properly labelled.\n\n12. Use linewidths big enough to read. 1pt lines tend to disappear if plots are shrunk. \n\n13. Avoid overlapping text on plotting characters or lines.\n\n14. Follow Tufte’s principles by removing chart junk and keeping a high data-ink ratio.\n\n15. Plots should be self-explanatory, so include detailed captions.\n\n16. Use a sensible aspect ratio. I think width:height of about 1.6 works well for most plots.\n\n17. Prepare graphics in the final aspect ratio to be used in the publication. Distorted fonts look awful.\n\n18. Use points not lines if element order is not relevant.\n\n19. When preparing plots that are meant to be compared, use the same scale for all of them. Even better, combine plots into a single graph if they are related.\n\n20. Avoid pie-charts. Especially 3d pie-charts. Especially 3d pie-charts with exploding wedges. I promise all my students an instant fail if I ever see anything so appalling.\n\n    Visualizations\n\n<https://twitter.com/asjadnaqvi/status/1513863752201998340?s=12&t=Zbxqxo5GBwdUGsn30Nc-Lw>\n\n<https://medium.com/the-stata-guide> \n\nR - <https://twitter.com/f2harrell/status/1515284543204474881?s=21&t=1ZhOw-Mre83Ylh60daEZiw>\n\nDensity strips: <https://twitter.com/bmj_ebm/status/1482023471928516609?s=43&t=5eJ6uoTQrbbYTlHIOnRYRg> \n\n-   [ ] find attribution.\n\n![](images/clipboard-3417512272.png)\n\nAnd tables:\n\nTables- <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-benefit-cost-analysis/article/abs/ten-guidelines-for-better-tables/74C6FD9FEB12038A52A95B9FBCA05A12>\n\nStatistical Reporting\n\n-   [ ] find attribution\n\n![](images/clipboard-2595083390.png)\n\n### Introduction\n\nFormulating Hypothesis - specific, testable.
