# Overview {.unnumbered}

This workbook is intended to function as a guide to get students, residents, or fellows started on the right foot on a research project. 

There are many guides and publications covering this topic. The reason I made yet another is to better target the unique constraints and backgrounds of clinical trainees, and also to cover content relevant to my field - Internal Medicine (specifically, Pulmonary and Critical Care)

This guide is intended to act as a supplement to an involved mentor, who can answer context-specific questions and clarify things in a more interactive way. However, as discussed more in mentors - there are a spectrum of arrangements that work, and self-directed researchers may find more use for materials like this. 

[ ] Reframe this as a guide for trainees (whether working with me or whoever youâ€™re working with)

Also - the nerds have a concept called 'Tacit Knowledge' that I think is extremely useful: how do people who actually do this well operate?
